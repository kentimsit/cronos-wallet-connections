# Cronos Wallet Connections

## Overview

This is a boilerplate project using NextJS13 to demonstrate Web3 wallet connection on Cronos and basic interaction with the Cronos blockchain.

Requirement: Node 18+

## Project creation

This project was created with `npx create-next-app@latest`.

Project creation:

-   Use Typescript with NextJS 13 app.
-   Use ESLint.
-   We will not be using the src directory
-   We will definitely use the App Router with NextJS 13
-   Change the import alias to @

Configure port in `package.json`:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev -p 3000"
    }
}
```

Then, install and configure:

-   [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started/nextjs-guide)
-   [Zustand for state management](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
-   [Ethers.js] (https://docs.ethers.org/). Here we are using v5 (5.7.2), as V6 is introducing some breaking changes that are not yet fully supported by all libraries.
-   [Web3 Wallet](https://web3-wallet.github.io/web3-wallet/docs/getting-started)
-   [TypeChain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain) TypeScript bindings for your smart contracts

Web3 Wallet is an open-source wrapper developed especially to simplify the workflow of Cronos app developers, but it also supports other EVM compatible networks.

Then, create or update the /app directory.

## Env variables

See .env.example

## To launch the project locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To use from another device with ngrok (installed with Homebrew):

```bash
ngrok http --domain=domain-name.app 3000
```

## How to connect to Web3 wallet and Cronos blockchain

The Cronos blockchain is supported by Crypto.com DeFi Wallet, Rabby, MetaMask, Trust Wallet and a number of other wallets such as those listed [here](https://web3-wallet.github.io/web3-wallet/wallets/metamask).

In order to facilitate the use of these wallets by Cronos dapp developers, we recommend the use of [Web3-Wallet](https://web3-wallet.github.io/web3-wallet/docs/getting-started), a npm library used by several major Cronos dapps.

This repository uses Cronos mainnet, and demonstrates the use of Web3-Wallet with a NextJS 13 application:

-   The `./app/chains.ts` and `./app/wallets.ts` serve as configuration files
-   If you need to read data from the blockchain, you also need to enter a blockchain URL which is going to support your rate of requests in the .env file, under `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_URL`.
-   The `./app/components/Navbar` demonstrates how the app manages the user's connection to their preferred wallet using a basic Modal interface (in this example, Crypto.com DeFi Wallet, Rabby / MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Wallet Connect).
-   The `./app/components/ReadChain` demonstrates how to read information from the Cronos blockchain, such as the latest block number and the crypto asset balance of a user.
-   The `./app/components/WriteChain` demonstrates how to send a transaction to the Cronos blockchain (there are two examples: "send 1 CRO to myself" and "send 1 USDC to myself").

## How to interact with smart contracts?

-   Add your smart contract [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/abi-spec.html) to `./contracts/abis/[contractName].json`.
-   Run `npm run typechain` to generate all the typescript bindings for your smart contract.
-   Check `./app/components/ReadChain` or `./app/components/WriteChain` for how to create a contract object and interact with your smart contract through the contract object.

## How to setup another blockchain?

At present, this demo is configured to work with Cronos Mainnet and Cronos Testnet. However, if you need to set up an additional EVM compatible chain, you may proceed with the following steps.

Let's say you want to add myChain to your dApp:

1. Update `./global.d.ts` accordingly:

```typescript
interface ProcessEnv {
    readonly NEXT_PUBLIC_CRONOS_MAINNET_RPC_URL: string;
    readonly NEXT_PUBLIC_CRONOS_TESTNET_RPC_URL: string;
    readonly NEXT_PUBLIC_MY_CHAIN_RPC_URL: string;

    readonly NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK:
        | "cronosMainnet"
        | "cronosTestnet"
        | "myChain";
}
```

2. Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK` env variable in `./.env` to `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=myChain`.

3. Add your chain configuration in `./app/chains.ts`:

```typescript
export enum ChainId {
    CronosMainnet = 25,
    CronosTestnet = 338,
    MyChain = ???
};

export const chainConfigs: ChainConfig[] = [
    ...
    {
        chainId: ChainId.MyChain,
        chainName: "My Chain",
        rpcUrls: [process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MY_CHAIN_RPC_URL],
        ...
    }
]
```

## Work in process

The `./app/api` and `./app/protected` routes are unused at the moment, could be used in a future version of this repository which demonstrates login via message signing.
